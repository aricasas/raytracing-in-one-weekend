This is a Ray Tracer based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) but implemented in Rust.

It outputs a .ppm image

To use it, you'll need to have [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed. Then, just enter the main directory and run this command
```
cargo run --release > out.ppm
```
